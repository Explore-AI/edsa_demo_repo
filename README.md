## Overview
"As the Corrupt Evil Overlord here at Evil Overlord Inc., I'd like to take a moment to welcome you to our repository. I hope that as you look around, you find the scheming, oppression, and ruthlessness you are looking for. But wee hope that you also find something else: caring and commitment.

We realise that today Evil Overlords are more prevalent than ever before. With so many out there vying for global domination, it takes something secial for one to emerge as an industry leader. Here at Evil Overlord Inc, we care about the individual. Other Overlords have shown a tendancy to make broad sweeping plans and think in terms of vast armies. But we believe that this is a mistake; every individual is different and has different strengths and weaknesses. If we don't take the time to learn about them and adjust our plans, then we're not doing our jobs. It is somewhat of a clich√© these days, but we are proud to say that we 'think global and act local'. You have our promise that each and every one of you will be carefully scrutinized, assessed, and dealt with accordingly."
